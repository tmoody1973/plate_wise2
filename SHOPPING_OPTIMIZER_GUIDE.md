The PlateWise Shopping Optimizer helps you shop more efficiently by finding the best stores for your recipe ingredients and organizing your shopping trip to save time and money.

## Step-by-Step User Process

- You'll see accurate costs for each ingredient at different stores

### 2. **Choose Your Preferred Store** 🏪
- Select your favorite primary store (Pick 'n Save, Metro Market, etc.)
- The system will try to find as many ingredients as possible at your preferred location

### 3. **Optimize Your Shopping Plan** ⚡
- Click "Optimize Shopping Plan"
- See your **efficiency score** (% of ingredients at your primary store)
- Get **total cost** and **estimated shopping time**
- View organized **shopping list by store**

### 4. **Follow Your Shopping Route** 🗺️
- Start at your primary store for most items
- Visit specialty stores (like Asian International Market) only for items not available elsewhere
- Check off items as you shop with the interactive checklist

## What You Get

### **Efficiency Analysis**
- **85%+ Efficiency**: Most ingredients at your preferred store
- **60-84% Efficiency**: Good balance, 1-2 additional stores needed
- **<60% Efficiency**: Consider choosing a different primary store

### **Cost Breakdown**
- **Total Checkout Cost**: What you'll actually pay at stores
- **Portion Cost**: Just for the recipe amount (informational)

### **Time Estimates**

### **Smart Store Assignment**
- **Common ingredients** → Your preferred mainstream store
- **Specialty ingredients** (dashi, miso, etc.) → Asian International Market
- **Best prices** → Automatic comparison when items available at multiple stores

## Troubleshooting

**"No pricing data found"**

- Wait for the pricing to fully load (shows green total)
- Try refreshing the page if pricing seems stuck

**"0% efficiency" or empty plan**
- This indicates a data connection issue
- The pricing data from Perplexity isn't reaching the optimizer
- Try getting fresh pricing data

**Store seems wrong**
- We use verified Milwaukee store addresses
- If a store location seems off, the optimizer uses our database of confirmed addresses
- Asian International Market is specifically at 3401 W National Ave (corrected from other online listings)
