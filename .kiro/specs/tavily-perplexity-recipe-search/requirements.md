# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a hybrid recipe search system that combines Tavily Search API for superior URL discovery with Perplexity AI for intelligent recipe content parsing. The system addresses the core problem of getting reliable, individual recipe page URLs while maintaining cultural authenticity and structured recipe data. This approach leverages Tavily's AI-optimized search capabilities with Perplexity's excellent content analysis.
