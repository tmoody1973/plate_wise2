# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a hybrid recipe search system that combines Brave Search API for accurate URL discovery with Perplexity AI for intelligent recipe content parsing. The system addresses the core problem of getting reliable, individual recipe page URLs while maintaining cultural authenticity and structured recipe data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hybrid Search Architecture

**User Story:** As a meal planner user, I want to receive accurate recipe URLs that actually work, so that I can access the full recipe details on the original website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recipe search is requested THEN the system SHALL use Brave Search API to find real recipe URLs from trusted cooking websites
2. WHEN Brave Search returns results THEN the system SHALL filter for individual recipe pages only (not collection pages)
3. WHEN valid URLs are found THEN the system SHALL use Perplexity AI to parse each recipe page into structured JSON
4. IF either API fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN the search completes THEN the system SHALL return recipes with verified working URLs

### Requirement 2: Brave Search Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Brave Search API to find accurate recipe URLs, so that users get working links to real recipe pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for recipes THEN the system SHALL construct targeted search queries using site-specific filters
2. WHEN querying Brave Search THEN the system SHALL include trusted recipe domains (allrecipes.com, foodnetwork.com, seriouseats.com, etc.)
3. WHEN filtering results THEN the system SHALL exclude collection pages, category pages, and video content
4. WHEN processing results THEN the system SHALL validate URLs are individual recipe pages
5. WHEN rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic

### Requirement 3: Perplexity Recipe Parsing

**User Story:** As a meal planner user, I want recipe content to be parsed into structured data with cultural context, so that I can understand the dish's background and cooking requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing a recipe URL THEN Perplexity SHALL extract title, description, ingredients, and instructions
2. WHEN analyzing recipe content THEN Perplexity SHALL provide cultural context and authenticity information
3. WHEN structuring data THEN the system SHALL format ingredients with measurements and instructions as ordered steps
4. WHEN extracting images THEN the system SHALL attempt to find og:image or primary recipe images
5. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and fallback content

### Requirement 4: Cultural Authenticity and Dietary Filtering

**User Story:** As a culturally-conscious user, I want recipes that respect traditional cooking methods and accommodate my dietary restrictions, so that I can maintain authenticity while meeting my nutritional needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching by cuisine THEN the system SHALL prioritize authentic traditional recipes
2. WHEN dietary restrictions are specified THEN the system SHALL filter recipes accordingly (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
3. WHEN presenting recipes THEN the system SHALL include cultural context and significance
4. WHEN adapting traditional recipes THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate modifications and their impact
5. WHEN no authentic options exist THEN the system SHALL suggest the closest traditional alternatives

### Requirement 5: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want recipe searches to be fast and reliable, so that I can quickly find recipes without encountering errors or delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing searches THEN the system SHALL complete within 10 seconds for 3 recipes
2. WHEN APIs are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide cached results or graceful degradation
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL queue requests and retry with backoff
5. WHEN successful THEN the system SHALL cache results for 1 hour to improve performance

### Requirement 6: Cost Management and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor API usage and costs, so that I can optimize performance and stay within budget constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL track usage metrics for both Brave Search and Perplexity
2. WHEN costs exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators
3. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching strategies
4. WHEN monitoring usage THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing API call patterns
5. WHEN budgets are reached THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to cached or simplified results

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to work reliably even when individual components fail, so that I always receive useful recipe results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Brave Search fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to curated recipe URLs or previous successful searches
2. WHEN Perplexity parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide basic recipe structure with available data
3. WHEN both services fail THEN the system SHALL return cached results or offline recipe database
4. WHEN partial failures occur THEN the system SHALL return available results with clear status indicators
5. WHEN recovering from failures THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 8: Data Quality and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive high-quality, accurate recipe data, so that I can successfully cook the dishes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating URLs THEN the system SHALL verify links return 200 status codes
2. WHEN parsing ingredients THEN the system SHALL ensure measurements and quantities are properly formatted
3. WHEN extracting instructions THEN the system SHALL maintain logical step ordering and completeness
4. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL validate image URLs are accessible and relevant
5. WHEN detecting low-quality data THEN the system SHALL either improve it or exclude it from results
