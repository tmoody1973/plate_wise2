# üîç URL Investigation Results

## **URLs That Were Rejected**

Let me check these URLs that were marked as invalid:

1. `https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/maneet-chauhan/aloo-gobi-recipe-2106884`
2. `https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/maneet-chauhan/saag-paneer-recipe-2106885` 
3. `https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/maneet-chauhan/chicken-tikka-masala-recipe-2106883`
4. `https://www.seriouseats.com/butter-chicken-murgh-makhani-recipe`
5. `https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214931/chicken-biryani/`
6. `https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/masala-dosa`
7. `https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/lamb-rogan-josh/`

## **The Problem**

These URLs look legitimate but are likely:
- **AI-generated patterns** that don't actually exist
- **Constructed URLs** based on recipe names but wrong IDs
- **Outdated URLs** that have been moved or removed

## **Why This Keeps Happening**

1. **AI Hallucination**: Even with strict prompts, AI models create plausible URLs
2. **Pattern Recognition**: AI sees URL patterns and constructs similar ones
3. **Training Data Lag**: URLs in training data may no longer exist
4. **Recipe Site Changes**: Food websites frequently reorganize content

## **Better Solutions**

### 1. **Use Real, Verified URLs Only**
Instead of asking AI to find URLs, provide a curated list of working URLs.

### 2. **Recipe API Integration** 
Use APIs that guarantee working URLs:
- Spoonacular API
- Edamam Recipe API
- TheMealDB API

### 3. **Web Scraping with Search**
Use Google Custom Search API to find actual recipe pages.

### 4. **Curated Recipe Database**
Build and maintain our own database of verified recipe URLs.

## **Immediate Fix**

The URL validation is working correctly - it's catching invalid URLs that Perplexity is generating. We need to:

1. **Keep the validation** (it's doing its job)
2. **Improve the fallback system** with more verified URLs
3. **Consider switching to recipe APIs** for guaranteed working URLs

The validation isn't the problem - the AI-generated URLs are the problem!
